## Calculate FSC manually
Using [e2proc3d](http://sphire.mpg.de/wiki/doku.php?id=pipeline:utilities:e2proc3d)

## Mask takes [CryoSparc](https://discuss.cryosparc.com/t/tight-corrected-and-loose-gsfsc-curves/201/5) for example

### No Mask:
This is the raw FSC calculated between two independent half-maps reconstructed from the data. There is no masking applied, so both the structure and solvent are included in this FSC.

### Spherical:
This is the FSC calculated after applying a soft spherical mask to both half maps. The outer radius of the soft sphere is equal to half the volume box-size (i.e. the sphere extends to the faces of the box in all directions). The inner radius is 85 percent of the outer radius. Between inner and outer radii, a soft cosine edge transitions from a mask value of one to a value of zero.

### Loose:
This is the FSC calculated after applying a soft solvent mask to both half maps. The loose mask is calculated as follows. First, the density map is thresholded at 50% of the maximum density value. The resulting volume is dilated to create a soft mask. Voxels in the mask that are within 25 angstroms of the thresholded region receive a mask value of 1.0. Voxels between 25 and 40 angstroms fall off with a soft cosine edge, and voxels outside 40 angstroms receive a value of 0.0.

### Tight:
This is the same as the loose mask, except the dilation distances are 6 angstroms for the value 1.0 distance and 12 angstroms for the value 0.0 distance.

### Corrected:
This is the FSC curve calculated using the tight mask with correction by noise substitution [1]. The two half maps have their phases randomized beyond a certain resolution, then the tight mask is applied to both, and an FSC is calculated. This FSC is used along with the original FSC before phase randomization to compute the corrected FSC as in [1]. This accounts for correlation effects induced by masking. The resolution at which phase randomization begins is the resolution at which the no-mask FSC drops below the FSC = 0.143 criterion.

## Performing Focus Classification
### Using Chimera
### [CisTEM](https://cistem.org/frequently-asked-questions#tab-1-4)
A focus mask is defined as a sphere specified by radius and x,y,z coordinates of the sphere center, all given in Ã…. In order to find x,y,z, in CisTEM
1. Open the 3D map in Chimera. The map should be assigned model #0.
1. Display the command line by selecting Tools > General Controls > Command Line.
1. Execute vop threshold #0 maximum -1000 setMaximum 1.0 (this assumes that the minimum voxel value in the 3D map is larger than 1000). This will create a new model #1.
1. Execute shape sphere radius 30 color red mesh true on the Command Line. This will generate a sphere with a 30 Ã… radius, numbered model #2 (change the radius as needed).
1. Open Tools > General Controls > Model Panel and deactivate models #0 and #1. Then move the sphere (model #2) into model #1 until it is fully contained in that volume.
1. Execute mask #1 #2 on the Command Line. This will generate a new model #3 of a solid sphere with a 30 Ã… radius.
1. Close models #1 and #2 in Model Panel and make sure model #0 is visible but deactive.
1. Select model #3 (the solid sphere) in Volume Viewer and change its color to red (or something easily distiguishable from the original 3D map) and make it transparent.
1. Move model #3 to the desired location of the focus mask in the 3D map.
1. Execute vop resample #3 onGrid #0 on the Command Line. This will generate a copy of the solid sphere as a new model #1, now resampled in the same coordinate system as the original 3D map.
1. Execute measure center #1 on the Command Line. This will display the x,y,z coordinates of the mask in pixel coordinates below the command line. These coordinates have to be converted to Ã… by multiplying them with the pixel size of the 3D map before they can be used in cisTEM's Manual Refine panel.
